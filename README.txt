  Artsy at Heart README
-------------------------

Hello, this project was made by Gage Schaffer and Sophia Baker. This website started out as an attempt to bring the work of an artist to the internet, and what was once a simple website that just got the job done, turned into a website that we can be proud of. We worked very hard on this and overhauled many things, all in an effort to make a website that the artist would love, and that people viewing it could navigate with ease and efficiency.


Whole Website:

-The name "Artsy at Heart" was actually coined for the purpose of this website. Beforehand, the artist simply had her art and her classes with no name. She made the name because she wanted to show her absolute love for her artwork.

-The layout was inspired by a collection of popular artists' websites. Most of them looked very nice and professional. Each followed what seemed to be a pattern: centered header and navigation, seperate blocks of content, and different pages for different styles of their artwork.

-The color scheme was selected by the artist, but we made subtle changes to make sure the colors weren't so harsh on the viewer, all the while keeping the artist's wants in mind. She had originally wanted a slightly brighter version of our final pallette with more colors, but she agreed that the darker colors with less variety helped visibility.

-We checked the responsiveness of the website using the developer tools in Google Chrome by viewing the pages with the preset sizes of devices in order to make sure that the website looked good at any screen size.

-The favicon is a simple logo that the artist agreed on. While it is not present on the website, due to her not wanting a logo to be identified with her artwork, we still had permission to use it as the favicon to make the website more professional and complete.


Home Page:

-The seperated blocks of content all provide a snippet of material that are present on other pages. We made sure to make it look appealing, simple to read, and easy to navigate. We also made sure to feature the artist's prominent works on the front, as per her request.

-The first block is dedicated solely to her artwork, with her more popular pieces being featured. The works are on the left with a brief description of each picture beside them. There is a link, at the bottom of the first block, to the gallety page of our website. The second block is dedicated to the classes that artist offers the public. The picture on the right is a shot from a recent class, while the description on the left was approved by the client; a link is present below this block as well linking to the classes page of our website. The third block is about the custom artwork, and is set up the same as the first block with a link connected to the custom page.
